      "description": "I'm a <strong>computer engineer</strong> and <strong>game developer</strong> currently based in <strong>Warsaw</strong>. I have a passion for building strange worlds and the sturdy code that supports them. Whether it's a reliable <strong>backend system</strong> or a game mechanic that lets you play as a destructive cat, I love the process of creation.<br><br>On the tech side, I build functional platforms like <strong>GamerLog</strong> (Django) and creative tools like <strong>Bitmapify</strong>. I even combined my love for sports and code to build an <strong>AI-powered NBA match predictor</strong>.<br><br>Creatively, I live in <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. I've explored narrative horror in <strong>Echoes of Stella</strong>, arcade survival in <strong>Swarmbreaker</strong>, and pure chaos in <strong>In A Bad Mewd</strong>. I also collaborated on the high-speed sports game <strong>Killwats League</strong>.<br><br>With a degree in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>, I'm now diving deeper into the industry through <strong>Game Programming at Futuregames</strong>. When I’m not debugging, you'll find me making music or jumping into random creative side quests."
